## Game of Thrones Edition

[Code and live demo @ Hyperdev](https://hyperdev.com/#!/project/thorn-hound)

Project description [here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine):

### Requirements

- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/).

- Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

- Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

- User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.


### Known bugs

- the app was written in ES6 and is (not yet) backwards compatible, for more information see this [table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
